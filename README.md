Hello everybody,
I will tell you a joke how about that,  just came to realize that debugging is like  being the detective in a crime drama where you are also the murderer,
Okay jokes aside. Facts, I am the INFj personality type, the rarest type. I have never lied about my age or be secretive about it, I like getting old. My mother told me to wait until i get 30 and i think she has a point.
